Preparation of batter- 

1. Sieve the all-purpose flour, powdered sugar, baking powder, baking soda and choco powder several times till they are evenly mixed and distributed.

2. Blend the eggs and refine oil into a fine and smooth liquid.

3. Collect the sieved powder-mix in a bowl-shaped container. Slowly, pour the liquid into the powder-mix and keep mixing at the same time.

4. Stir the entire batter in a medium pace. After it reaches a thick and even consistency, gently pour just a little milk into the batter and blend it well. Keep on adding little-by-little of the milk until the batter reaches a consistency where it pours down smoothly upon lifting the spoon up.

5. Add the vanilla essence and then lastly, the vinegar.

Baking the cake-

1. Take a microwave-safe cake tray and grease it well.

2. Set the microwave in convection mode and pre-heat it at a 180 degrees.

3. While the microwave heats, pour the batter into the tray and set the tray on a microwave low-rack.

4. The pre-heating should be done in 3-4 minutes. Set the low-rack with the cake-tray on top of it, inside the microwave. Set the timer of the microwave for about 30 minutes. 

5. Keep checking the cake occasionally while its baking. 

6. And Voila! You have a delicious CHOCOLATE CAKE!
